# AI-ML-in-Drug-Discovery

Traditional drug discovery is a slow and cost ineffective process spanning over 15-20 years. This repository explores how different aspects of drug discovery can be evolved using machine learning such as NLP techniques (like chemical text mining and embeddings) and predictive modelling to identify potential drug candidates faster and more efficiently. Each aspect has a dedicated directory for itself, feel free to explore.

## Features
- Named Entity Recognition (NER) for drug and compound identification
- Predictive modelling for bioactivity and toxicity
- Drug repuposing
- DeepDTA etc.,

## Tech Stack
- Python (scikit-learn, pandas, NumPy)
- NLP: spaCy
- Deep Learning: PyTorch and TensorFlow
- Visualization: matplotlib, seaborn
