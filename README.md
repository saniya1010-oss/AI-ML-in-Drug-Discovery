# AI-ML-in-Drug-Discovery

##Traditional drug discovery is a slow and cost ineffective process spanning over 15-20 years. This repository explores how NLP techniques (like chemical text
mining and embeddings) and predictive modelling can help identify potential drug candidates faster and more efficiently.

## Features
- Named Entity Recognition (NER) for drug and compound identification
- Predictive modelling for bioactivity and toxicity

## Tech Stack
- Python (scikit-learn, pandas, NumPy)
- NLP: spaCy
- Deep Learning: PyTorch and TensorFlow
- Visualization: matplotlib, seaborn
